### **0x00. Python - AirBnB_clone:  The Console**
**`Python`** **`Group Project`** **`OOP`** **`AirBnB_clone`**

**Project Description**

Step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB clone.

**First step**: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

Each task is linked and will help you to:

1. put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
2. create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
3. create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
4. create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
5. create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.
